# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This document contains information to perform an analysis on the Human Activity Recognition dataset.

## Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

- **CodeBook.md** is a codebook that describes the variables, data modifications, and any transformation or work that was done to clean up the dataset.

- **run_analysis.R** is an R script and contains the project requirements:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
